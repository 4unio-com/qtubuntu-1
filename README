1. Description
--------------

  This repository provides Qt bindings for those Mir APIs that are not exposed 
  through the QPA plugins but are needed for the functionality of the Unity shell.


2. Building
-----------

  To compile Unity-Mir, create the makefiles with qmake and build with
  make:

    $ qmake
    $ make

  By default, Unity-Mir compiles a release build. To compile a debug
  build, the following qmake command should be used:

    $ qmake CONFIG+=debug
